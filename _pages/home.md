## Profile   

I am a business development & data analytics enthusiast with economics, business, and tech background. I have diverse experience across industries in China, Austria, and Switzerland. I am customer- and solution-oriented with quick learning ability and strong adaptability.   

I completed my Master's degree in Global Sales and Marketing at the University of Applied Science Upper Austria. At the same time, I took Business Informatics classes at Johannes Kepler University Linz, which allowed me to gain an understanding of programming and data science, which I used in a part-time job as a software tester. I researched the adoption of blockchain in Switzerland for my Master's thesis after moving to Zurich last year (2019). Since then, I have been learning more about data science and successfully completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.   

I grew up in China, lived in Austria for 3.5 years, and have been living in Switzerland since the beginning of 2019. Besides liking to travel, I am an avid hiker and spend my weekends on the mountains. I also like to attend meetups on various technology-related topics, which allow me to learn and network. I want to develop myself further in the area with the combination of business and technology, e.g. as a data/business/strategy analyst, transformation specialist, and project manager. I'd love to meet and exchange ideas with like-minded people. Please feel free to reach out to me and I look forward to hearing from you.
