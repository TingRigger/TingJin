<b>Profile</b>  
---
I am a global sales and marketing scholar, data analyst, and technology enthusiast. I completed my Master's degree in Global Sales and Marketing at the University of Applied Science Upper Austria. At the same time, I took Business Informatics classes at Johannes Kepler University Linz, which allowed me to gain an understanding of programming and data science, which I used in a part-time job as a software tester. I researched the adoption of blockchain in Switzerland for my Master's thesis after moving to Zurich last year (2019). Since then, I have been learning more about data science and successfully completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

I grew up in China, but I was living in Austria for 3.5 years. Besides liking to travel, I am an avid hiker and spend my weekends on the mountains. I also like to attend meetups on various technology-related topics, which allow me to learn and network. I want to develop myself as a Data Scientist and I'd love to meet and exchange ideas with like-minded people. Please feel free to reach out to me and I look forward to hearing from you.
